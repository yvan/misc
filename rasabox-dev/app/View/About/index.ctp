			<strong>What is rasabox?</strong></br></br>

	rasabox is a place to find good 3D models to print. We
	are building a community of people who 
	care about printing and design.

	</p>
	</br></br>
	<p>
		<strong>Why did we make it?</strong></br></br>

	We were unsatisfied with the superfluous nature of current 
	platforms. We felt that we could make a website 
	that is just about content with real ranking.  

	</p>
	</br></br>
	<p>
		<strong>We appreciate any and especially negative feedback.</strong></br></br>
	 
	Please offer us your constructive criticism.

		<strong>If you are a passionate  weirdo and  can code like a cowboy</strong>
	 	send us an email, or a tweet, or contact through some yet undiscovered medium. We are 
		looking for people to help us build
	 	a great community.

		<strong>We reccommend Pleasant3D 3D viewer for viewing
		and printing models. It is simple and robust.</strong></br></br>
