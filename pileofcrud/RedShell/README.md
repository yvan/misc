RedShell
========
The idea was to make a shell for people making algorithms that would
give them access to tools for extensive backtesting with one line
commands. It would also let them download data like bloomberg. Never
got around to finishing it.

I used mongoDB to transfer data into excel files (kind of the way the bloomberg API does).

The commands that work are documented in the manFiles directory.
