treemalloc
==========

Memory allocator that uses a tree to organize free blocks of memory.

The inspiration for this definitely came from someone who did something related with trees somewhere out on the great wide web, forgot to write down the link when I read that article.

This acheived a perfect score on a testing server testing for speed, efficiency, and fragmentation.
