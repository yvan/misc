**first neural network**

this was my first neural net.

i predicted bike ridership using the UCI bike rental dataset. the neural network has one hidden layer and i implemented gradient descent and bacepropagation algorithms to train it. the code is written python3 in numpy and pandas.

check the [first_neural_network.ipynb](https://github.com/yvan/first-neural-network/blob/master/first_neural_network.ipynb) file for details.

i trained it locally on my computer.
