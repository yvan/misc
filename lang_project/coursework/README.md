Hi Yvan, 

sure! Most of the materials are actually publicly available. For PL, I 
suggest to take a look at the version from this semester which is 
slightly updated. The syllabus on the course website has links to the 
class notes. The homework assignments should also be publicly available. 
You can find them at 

https://github.com/nyu-pl-sp19/hw02/ 

and similarly for later assignments. 

For RSD, you can find the slides at: 

https://cs.nyu.edu/wies/teaching/rsd-sp16/materials/class01.pdf 

and so forth. The assignments are at: 

https://cs.nyu.edu/wies/teaching/rsd-sp16/materials/hw01.pdf 

etc. 

For OOP, you can send me your Github ID and then I can give you access 
to the materials. 

Best, 
Thomas
