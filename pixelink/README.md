# pixelink
This is a google chrome plugin that I'm messing around with. It completely breaks any website the client vists (at least from the perspective of the user). Experiments with "no-script."


Usage
=====

Use this to clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yvanscher/pixelink.git`

Then:
To enable the plugin on your own machine for experimenting you should go to chrome settings (the three little bars in the top right of your chrome).
Now in the top left-ish click on "Extensions" and click "Load unpacked extension..." and then select the folder you just created with git clone.

*BE WARNED* once the plugin is enabled any site you visit will be screwed up, unavgiable, and your chrome may crash. You have been warned. Also it crashes Shockwave flash (on sites that use it like facebook.com).

To stop the madness just turn off the plugin by unchecking the little box next to "Enable" on your extensions manager where you just unpacked the extension. You can find the plugin manager at the url `chrome://extensions/` just in case you left the page.

This software is not intended to be malicious or misused in any way. It's just an experiment to see what browsers can and can't do. Don't run around installing this on your untech savvy friend's computers. It definitely will not be totally hilarious.
